## Well log data analysis exercise

Overall time 1 hour (50 minutes coding, 10 minutes review and discussion)

Exercise aim is to load well data, visualize well logs and place sequence stratigraphic picks into a single well using available data.

## Sequence stratigraphic pick biozone association
MRS 2 - B2a
MFS 1 - B2b
MRS 1 - B3

## Basic instructions
* Read the provided well log ('WA1.txt') and biozone ('WA1_biozones.csv') files
* Identify peaks and troughs in the relevant logs, in order to help you identify significant local variations in the data that may be indicative of lithological changes
* Plot well logs and biozones versus depth, marking the detected peaks and troughs.
*Based on the provided information place the Sequence stratigraphic picks and return their depths
